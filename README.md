# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a person is at risk of heart disease using key medical parameters such as cholesterol, blood pressure, and age.  
The goal is to help early detection through data-driven insights.

---

## 📘 Overview
Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of death globally.  
This project uses a dataset from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository** to build predictive models that can assist in medical decision-making.

---

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source:** [UCI Heart Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease)  
- **Samples:** 303  
- **Features:** 13  
- **Target:** 1 = Disease, 0 = No Disease

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  

---

## 🚀 Model
- **Algorithms Used:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN, Decision Tree  
- **Best Model:** Random Forest Classifier  
- **Accuracy:** ~85–88%  

---

## 📈 Results
Random Forest provided the best performance with balanced precision and recall.  
Feature importance shows that age, cholesterol, and max heart rate are significant predictors.

---

## 💡 Future Improvements
- Tune hyperparameters with GridSearchCV  
- Build a web app using Streamlit  
- Integrate real-time data visualization for clinicians
